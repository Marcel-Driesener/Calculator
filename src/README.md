# Kotlin Calculator Guide

## How It Works
The Kotlin Calculator is a simple console-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Execute
1. **Install Kotlin:** Make sure you have Kotlin installed. You can download it from [kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/).
2. **Save Code:** Copy the code into a file named `Calculator.kt`.
3. **Compile:** Open a terminal and run:  
```sh
kotlinc Calculator.kt -include-runtime -d Calculator.jar
```
4. **Run:** Execute the compiled program with:  
```sh
java -jar Calculator.jar
```

## Example
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose which Operation you need (only the number): 1
The result is: 15.0
```

And that's it! Enjoy using the Kotlin Calculator!
